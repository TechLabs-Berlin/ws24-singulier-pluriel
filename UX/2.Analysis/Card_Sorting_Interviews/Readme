These are recordings of card-sorting interviews I performed with course instructors and students to see how they would distribute tasks
and functions of the LMS across different categories. One big takeaway from these interviews (see for instance the one with Carla)
was that they lead us to reduce the 4 categories we originally had (Courses, Communication, Announcements, Grade Center) to 3 
(Communication and Announcements were merged together).
