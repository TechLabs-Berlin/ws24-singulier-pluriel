This folder includes recordings of users testing our Figma prototype for the LMS.
All of the users are lecturers or teachers active in a university or school context.
The users were all asked to think aloud while performing the tasks.
The folders also includes a file containing the introduction I gave the users before starting the test,
and the complete list of tasks I asked them to perform.
More information on the insight gained through the user interviews can be found in the Blog Post.
